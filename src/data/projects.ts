        "description": "Cosmo is the interpreter no one asked for—but I built it anyway, completely from scratch in TypeScript. It boasts a custom syntax, basic arithmetic, variable assignments, and a tiny standard library with functions like add, sqrt, and clock. While it's not meant for practical use, building Cosmo was an exciting dive into interpreter design. \n\n I also have a Java implementation as well!",

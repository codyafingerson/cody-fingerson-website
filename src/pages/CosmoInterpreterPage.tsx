        Cosmo is the interpreter absolutely no one asked for, but I built it anyway! Crafted from scratch,
        Cosmo was my grand adventure into the mysterious realm of interpreter design and
        programming language implementation. Does it serve a practical purpose?
        Absolutely not. But creating Cosmo was a blast and taught me more about interpreters than
        I ever thought I'd know. Why I chose TypeScript is beyond me, but here we are, lmao!

        Conclusion

      <p className="mt-2 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Cosmo may not revolutionize technology as we know it, but it sure made my coding journey more
        interesting. It's proof that with a bit of determination (and a disregard for sanity),
        you can create something uniquely your ownâ€”even if it serves absolutely no practical purpose.
